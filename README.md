This code determines the number of _split dominating sets_(SDSs) in connected graphs with 4,5 and 6 vertices. In addition, it prints out the extremal graph.
A SDS of a graph G is a _dominatinng set_ S such that G-S results in a disconnected graph.
A set S of vertices of a graph G is a called a dominating set of G, if every vertex of G is either in S or has a neighbour in S.
